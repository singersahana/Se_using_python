# Selenium Project

This project demonstrates how to use Selenium for web scraping and browser automation in Python.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver)

## Installation

1. Install Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)

2. Install Selenium using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install selenium
Download the WebDriver for your browser:

ChromeDriver

GeckoDriver

Add the WebDriver executable to your system's PATH.

Usage
Import the necessary libraries:

python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time
Initialize the WebDriver and open a web page:

python
driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # or webdriver.Firefox() for GeckoDriver
driver.get("https://www.example.com")
Interact with web elements:

python
search_box = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "q")
search_box.send_keys("Selenium WebDriver" + Keys.RETURN)
time.sleep(3)  # wait for the results to load

results = driver.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "h3")
for result in results:
    print(result.text)
Close the browser:

python
driver.quit()
